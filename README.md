A dump of the UK postcode district and area polygons from Wikipedia in KML and GeoJSON format

## Postcode areas? Districts?

See this [helpful guide](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/guides/uk-postcode-format) from Ideal Postcodes.

## What is this?

An export of the KML files linked from the [List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_postcode_districts_in_the_United_Kingdom) page, also converted to GeoJSON.

Note: Each GeoJSON file represents a postcode area and contains a `FeatureCollection`, with one `Feature` per constituent postcode district.

eg: https://github.com/missinglink/uk-postcode-polygons/blob/master/geojson/E.geojson

## Dependencies

sudo npm install -g @mapbox/geojson-rewind
```

or ...

```
sudo yarn global add @mapbox/togeojson

## Can I submit a pull request?

For the _data_? no. this repo should be considered read-only, all edits must be made to Wikipedia directly.

The index is sourced from [List_of_postcode_districts_in_the_United_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_postcode_districts_in_the_United_Kingdom) with each Area having a corresponding KML file attached.

You can edit the KML directly, eg: [CV_postcode_area](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Attached_KML/CV_postcode_area) which can also be accessed as [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Attached_KML/CV_postcode_area&action=raw).

For the _code_? yes, please do.
